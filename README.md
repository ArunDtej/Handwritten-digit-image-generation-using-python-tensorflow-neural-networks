# Handwritten-digit-image-generation-using-python-tensorflow-neural-networks
Training set contains images of hand written digits from 0 to 9, so if you want to add you own custom data then convert the digit image for training into 28 x 28 size image , you can even ectend this to recognize handwritten words, Good luck ;).
